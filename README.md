# TowerDefense
A tower defense game for my final Grade 12 project

A "tower defense" game is a game in which the objective is to prevent an army of enemies from reaching the player's base, as they advance by way of a predetermined path. This is done by setting up a variety of upgradeable towers that automatically fire on the advancing enemies. The player is afforded a bird's eye view of the entire map, and their construction and upgrading of towers is limited by a form of currency. The game ends if 20 enemies reach the player's base. The player may advance to the next stage by eliminating all of the enemies before all 20 lives are lost. Each stage is a greater challenge than the last; the enemy's health, speed or numbers will increase as each stage is cleared.
